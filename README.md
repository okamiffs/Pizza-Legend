# Pizza Legend
Pizza ordering website prototype.

# MVP
Pizza legend is a website where we aim to pizza to our customers. We allow users to sign up, create an order, edit and order or cancel an order and finally, submit the order so we can get working on delivering their pizza. We have a variety of toppings and pan sizes that customers can choose from and even the ability to name your pizza freely.

# Goals
* Sign up and sign in.
* Submit orders and view orders.
* Edit and delete orders.
* Styled.
